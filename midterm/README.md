## Midterm

### Summary

This is the midterm assignment for N320! It simulates a store webpage where users can add items to a cart- when they have items added and input their information (name and email) an "invoice" PDF is generated. The PDF contains all of the above information AS WELL AS the date and time the invoice was generated, an "invoice number" (random 8-digit number), and the total cost of the items.
